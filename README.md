## Getting Started

To get these up and running, perform the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/csmb/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
bash welcome.sh
```

Running `bash welcome.sh` will complete the following:

- Install the Homebrew Packages in `homebrew_install.sh`
- Install the one time setup script in `preferences.sh`
- Remove a dotfile, then symlink the new one from the repo
